<p>
    A menu node can be multiple different states and these states can effective there behavior.  It is important to
    understand these states and how they subtly effective the behavior of the menu why they are active.
</p>

<h3>Active</h3>
<p>The active state marks a node as active.  Meaning that the user has activated either the target itself or an
decendant node ot that target.  When a node activates it also bubble up the menu tree activating any parent nodes.
In practice only the immediate parent has the potential to be unactive as grandchildren of the first unactive menu
should be unreachable by the user.</p>

<p>
Once a menu has been activated it's behavior changes slightly.  It gets the <strong>.active</strong> class that the user
can use to style the menu why it is active.
